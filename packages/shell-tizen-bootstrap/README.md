# @jellyfin-tv/shell-tizen-bootstrap

Hosted Shell Bootstrap (HSB) for Samsung Tizen TVs.

## What this is

A near-immutable sub-580 KB WGT that gets installed **once** on a TV via
Samsung Device Manager GUI. At launch it:

1. Reads `serverUrl` from `localStorage`.
2. If absent → renders the connect form (same UX as the old shell).
3. If present → fetches `${server}/shell/manifest.json` (1.5 s timeout) and
   `<script src>`-loads the advertised `shell.min.js?sha=<hash>`.
4. On any failure → falls back to the baked `boot-shell.min.js` (last-known-good
   shell shipped inside this WGT; source of record in `boot-shell.src.js`).

After install, every shell update is a server-side file swap into
`${server}/shell/`. No `sdb shell`, no `pkgcmd`, no re-signing the WGT per
release.

See `INSTALL.md` for the install procedure and
`../server-shell-drop/README.md` for the canonical `${server}/shell/` layout.

## Build

```bash
pnpm --filter @jellyfin-tv/shell-tizen-bootstrap build
# or directly:
python3 scripts/build_bootstrap.py            # retail  -> dist/JellyPlug.wgt
python3 scripts/build_bootstrap.py --debug    # debug   -> dist/JellyPlug-Debug.wgt
```

Outputs:

- `dist/JellyPlug.wgt` — retail WGT (unsigned locally; sign with Tizen
  Studio Certificate Manager before pushing to a TV). Both on-screen
  diagnostic overlays stay opt-in (off on a fresh install).
- `dist/JellyPlug-Debug.wgt` (`--debug`, JEL-143) — identical shell with a
  one-line seed `<script>` injected as the first element of `<body>` so it
  runs before the bootloader. It sets `jellyfin.shell.debug=1` and
  `jellyfin.shell.hsbDebug=1` in `localStorage` on every boot, forcing on
  both the HSB bootstrap overlay (`#hsb-status`) and the shell diagnostics
  overlay (`#__shell_diag`). The committed `src/index.html` is never modified
  — the seed is a build-time transform.
- `manifest.bootstrap.json` — sha256 + size of the **retail** WGT, for
  advertising in `${server}/shell/` bootstrap-install flows. The `--debug`
  build never overwrites it.

The release pipeline (`.github/workflows/bootstrap-sign.yml`, tag
`bootstrap-v*`) signs **both** variants and attaches them to one GitHub
Release.

### Baked-in shell source (JEL-24)

The baked-in `src/boot-shell.min.js` is the deployed, on-device-validated
bootstrap shell. Its **maintainable source of record** is `src/boot-shell.src.js`
(a de-minified, prettier-formatted copy — mangle is OFF so it reads cleanly).
The two are kept in lock-step by a CI guard:

```bash
# Prove src == deployed (both canonicalized through the same esbuild):
python3 scripts/verify_boot_shell_src.py

# Regenerate boot-shell.min.js from source (esbuild minify + JEL manifest):
python3 scripts/build_boot_shell.py            # -> dist/ (review), runs the guard
python3 scripts/build_boot_shell.py --promote  # overwrite src/boot-shell.min.js
```

Edit `boot-shell.src.js`, not the minified blob. The CI `verify-shell-source`
job fails if the two diverge. Promoting a rebuild changes the bytes shipped to a
locked TV, so validate on-device before release.

> Historical note: the old `--shell-src ../_jel*_v80_src` flow is dead — that
> shell source tree was never committed and is lost. JEL-24 recovered the source
> by de-minifying the deployed artifact.

## Test

```bash
pnpm --filter @jellyfin-tv/shell-tizen-bootstrap test
# or directly:
node scripts/selftest.cjs
```

Covers four bootloader branches: no-server, manifest 200, script onerror
fallback, manifest network error.
