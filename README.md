## Quick Start

Pick the path that matches you:

| Path | Best for | What you do |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| **1. Pre-built WGT** | Most users. You just want Jellyfin on your Samsung TV. | Download the latest `Jellyfin.wgt` from [Releases](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-tizen/releases) and sideload it. You still need Developer Mode + a Samsung/Tizen certificate to install. See [Deployment](#deployment). |
| **2. Samsung-Jellyfin-Installer** | Users who want a guided installer instead of the Tizen CLI. | Use the community installer at [Jellyfin2Samsung/Samsung-Jellyfin-Installer](https://github.com/Jellyfin2Samsung/Samsung-Jellyfin-Installer). It wraps the certificate + sideload steps in a GUI. Community-maintained; not part of the Jellyfin project. |
| **3. Build from Source** | Developers, contributors, anyone tracking a non-release branch. | Follow [Build from Source](#build-from-source) below. |

> All three paths produce the same Tizen app. The difference is only how you obtain and install the WGT.

> Samsung Tizen TVs require Developer Mode and a signed certificate to sideload any app. There is no public Jellyfin entry in the Samsung Smart Hub store.

## Build from Source

_Also see the [Wiki](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-tizen/wiki)._

### Prerequisites
* Tizen Studio 4.6+ with IDE or Tizen Studio 4.6+ with CLI. See [Installing TV SDK](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/getting-started/setting-up-sdk/installing-tv-sdk.html).
* Git
* Node.js 20+

### Getting Started

1. Install prerequisites.
2. Install Certificate Manager using Tizen Studio Package Manager. See [Installing Required Extensions](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/getting-started/setting-up-sdk/installing-tv-sdk.html#Installing-Required-Extensions).
3. Setup Tizen certificate in Certificate Manager. See [Creating Certificates](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/getting-started/setting-up-sdk/creating-certificates.html).
   > If you have installation problems with the Tizen certificate, try creating a Samsung certificate. In this case, you will also need a Samsung account.
4. Clone or download [Jellyfin Web repository](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web).

   > It is recommended that the web version match the server version.

   ```sh
   git clone -b release-10.10.z https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web.git
   ```
   > Replace `release-10.10.z` with the name of the branch you want to build.

   > You can also use `git checkout` to switch branches.
5. Clone or download Jellyfin Tizen (this) repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-tizen.git
   ```

### Build Jellyfin Web

```sh
cd jellyfin-web
npm ci --no-audit
USE_SYSTEM_FONTS=1 npm run build:production
```

> You should get `jellyfin-web/dist/` directory.

> `USE_SYSTEM_FONTS=1` is required to discard unused fonts and to reduce the size of the app. (Since Jellyfin Web 10.9)

> Use `npm run build:development` if you want to debug the app.

If any changes are made to `jellyfin-web/`, the `jellyfin-web/dist/` directory will need to be rebuilt using the command above.

### Prepare Interface

```sh
cd jellyfin-tizen
JELLYFIN_WEB_DIR=../jellyfin-web/dist npm ci --no-audit
```

> You should get `jellyfin-tizen/www/` directory.

> The `JELLYFIN_WEB_DIR` environment variable can be used to override the location of `jellyfin-web`.

> Add `DISCARD_UNUSED_FONTS=1` environment variable to discard unused fonts and to reduce the size of the app. (Until Jellyfin Web 10.9)  
> Don't use it with Jellyfin Web 10.9+. Instead, use `USE_SYSTEM_FONTS=1` environment variable when building Jellyfin Web.

If any changes are made to `jellyfin-web/dist/`, the `jellyfin-tizen/www/` directory will need to be rebuilt using the command above.

### Build WGT

> Make sure you select the appropriate Certificate Profile in Tizen Certificate Manager. This determines which devices you can install the widget on.

```sh
tizen build-web -e ".*" -e gulpfile.babel.js -e README.md -e "node_modules/*" -e "package*.json" -e "yarn.lock"
tizen package -t wgt -o . -- .buildResult
```

> You should get `Jellyfin.wgt`.

## Deployment

### Deploy to Emulator

1. Run emulator.
2. Install package.
   ```sh
   tizen install -n Jellyfin.wgt -t T-samsung-5.5-x86
   ```
   > Specify target with `-t` option. Use `sdb devices` to list them.

### Deploy to TV

1. Run TV.
2. Activate Developer Mode on TV. See [Enable Developer Mode on the TV](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/getting-started/using-sdk/tv-device.html#Connecting-the-TV-and-SDK).
3. Connect to TV with one of the following options:
   * Device Manager from `Tools -> Device Manager` in Tizen Studio.

   * sdb:
      ```sh
      sdb connect YOUR_TV_IP
      ```
4. If you are using a Samsung certificate, allow installs onto your TV using your certificate with one of the following options:
   > If you need to change or create a new Samsung certificate (see [Getting-Started](#getting-started) step 3), you will need to [re-build WGT](#build-wgt) once you have the Samsung certificate you'll use for the install.

   * Device Manager from `Tools -> Device Manager` in Tizen Studio:
      * Right-click on the connected device, and select `Permit to install applications`.

   * Tizen CLI:
      ```sh
      tizen install-permit -t UE65NU7400
      ```
      > Specify target with `-t` option. Use `sdb devices` to list them.

   * sdb:
      ```sh
      sdb push ~/SamsungCertificate/<PROFILE_NAME>/*.xml /home/developer
      ```
5. Install package.
   ```sh
   tizen install -n Jellyfin.wgt -t UE65NU7400
   ```
   > Specify target with `-t` option. Use `sdb devices` to list them.
